# Project Plan: Tie-Dye Store

--- 

## Requirements
* **Back End**: 
    - Database with tables to store user info., purchase info., and stock info. 

* **Web API**: 
    - URLs will be relative for routing things like blog posts, specific product pages, etc. 

* **Data**: 
    - Option 2: User Data... the site will store user data such as purchases, and then will allow users to view a purchase history page. 
    - Users will also have certain blog update privilages while logged in. 

* **User / Admin Views**:
    - User views for blog / purchase history
    - Admin views for querying all user or purchase data. Admin view to potentially include simple dashboard of purchase activity. 

* **Deployment**: stretch goal if time allows.
